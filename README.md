# Tower-Defence-Game
This repository holds the source code team 2, the Grizzley Grill, created for their CMPE320 final project (C++). The project our team decided to develop was a tower defence game based on the rivalry between Western and Queen's university. Team members consisted of: Adam (me), Andrew, Arthur, Vanya, Grady, Keegan, and Jack. I developed the title screen, banner, graphics with Keegan, main with everyone, and helped create the framework for the implementation of the entity class and its children.
